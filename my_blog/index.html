                    Hello there! Kahnu charan Sahoo, a Y22 student in the Computer Science and Engineering Department. In this piece of text (I wouldn’t personally call it a blog), I will try to touch upon my life journey. It’s a bit crazy when I think back about it, that despite being told by almost everyone that I’ll be fine, I had no belief in me until I had my intern offer. All in all, maybe some of you can relate and find this piece of text helpful.
                </p>

                <p>
                    However, it is not impossible either. Here are five tips that’ll help you get better in front-end design and web development
                </p>

                        <p>
                            The journey of life had been so dramatic, as likewise others," my childhood was a bit sour and precisely was more appreciable once my 10th  result has got out. Moreover, I felt so happy once I got to know that My dad has completely taken that for granted and all set me, permitting me to pursue my intermediate in the field of science. Meanwhile, I got crashed, since my family belongs to a middle-class category. Therefore before making any decisions, I tend to think twice, Conversely looking at what others do! To achieve the same. Likewise, we came to a final decision to take admission to +2 regional college, which is located in Nimapada. There were some ups and downs, although my dad struggled to get me the degree. During my intermediate, I came across and finalize to make a career in defense. However, the problem was, even if I have appeared for the NDA exam. My family was not set to go and have a carrier in defense, because they believe, I am the only one who can get them a good life. So, review after review, finally i decided to get a carrier in the technical field, hence I have appeared for JEE exam.

                            Now officially, i have graduated from a tier 3 Engineering college, having the degree in the field of computer science and engineering. My overall experience, in regards to the theoretical aspects was quite acceptable, however i didn't quite follow the practical knowledge, due to lack of training and unavailability of good faculties, "who can guide and instruct me,for which,i need to aspire". Therefore i started to learn and get the required things on my own. Meanwhile i came across with many more colleagues and professors too. I would definitely like to address the COVID-19 pandemic scenario. So right after that my 3 ,4 and so on semester has begun eventually. Along with that i have enrolled for several internships and tech fests. Some how i felt , that i am on the right track. My internships are including diverse of background i.e" web development","campus ambassador" and etc. I never got a clew ,when i finally landed for my final year. But for the god's sake my semester results were so good,coz i never left and being apart from study, Since i am a hard-working student and enthusiastic.

                            Everything was good when it comes to my college but as we know a thing cannot be 100% perfect, so wise there were some downs in regards to the placement support. I have tried my level best to get a placement offer by going through and appearing one after another off.. campus drive. Hope you are aware of what the off-campus scenario is exactly all about..! Apart from that after a couple of months, I decided to enroll and be a part of Coding Ninjas.
                        </P>
                        &nbsp;
                        <p>
                            The decision that I made was a big turning point that ever happened in my life. Henceforth, I started to upgrade myself better as much as I could! During my Coding Ninjas classes, I truly found something more advantageous and got the opportunity for being an intern in Kalinga soft by the reference of my EX. College Director through LinkedIn. Am so grateful and blissful for considering me and encouraging me. The program is occupied with AI & ML concepts, which I would say help me to figure out my potential. Kalinga Soft is associated with Respect company which is based in Hongkong. My heartiest thanks to every member of the company not just only for being a good colleague but also for being my career guide. They never let me feel, that I am working under my superiors. More specifically they are like my own friends during my college times. I would again like to extend my heartful congratulations for their better life and success. So after a long time " classes after classes", and" internships after internships', I felt something more relaxed as I have done the best thing in my life. Because simultaneously I was involved with my career in Full stack development and projects. Therefore it sounds so overwhelming and pushes me to choose the right decision by boasting eventually.
                        </p>
                        &nbsp;
                        <p>
                            Ultimately, I am feeling so extraordinary because, I have turned on the right track, despite being on the unstructured path. If I'll consider my college, then I would rather say everything has changed consequently, whether it could be the placement support, principal's supervision, unequal mentorship, etc. As per my understanding. I would specifically like to thank Mr. Dhanananda for getting me in a good position and would consider my team members for their regardless support throughout the session.

                            Soon after got a 4.77 rating on a scale of 5 for continuously solving doubts in Coding Ninjas. I will endeavor to give my level best for the industry best practices across you. Thanks and best regards.

                        <p>
                            One important thing which people usually forget is that SPO is not the only way to get an intern at a ‘Good Company’ ( the parameters are subjective, ergo can’t go much into that). A large number of companies host many hackathons as well as off-campus hiring to recruit interns, therefore I believe that people should keep regular tabs on the hackathons being conducted, as well as have an active profile on LinkedIn, and connect with people. I cannot emphasize enough the importance of connecting with people. “Opportunities are manufactured,” says Biz Stone, and I really believe they are. So coming back,

                        <h2 class="h-style"> Preparation Period </h2>
                        <p>
                            Frankly speaking, my preparation was not too good, so to say. I started practicing coding a bit and some aptitude questions. In particular, I did not prepare for any specific profile or company, just did the usual stuff of coding and aptitude and almost filled for all the companies which were open for MSE. Since I wasn’t very familiar with CPP and not good at coding, it took time for me to solve questions due to which I often got frustrated.

                        &nbsp;
                        <p>
                            Nevertheless, though slow, I continued with the coding practice. Some of the resources which I used were Prepleaf for aptitude and Leetcode and Interview bit for coding. When the tests began, I did not perform very well in many tests. This was very depressing, and I was distraught. But then, there was this test in which I did well and ultimately secured the internship.

                            In the meantime, I would like to suggest to every individual '" just have patience, because good thing takes time to happen ".
